Cannot install react-router-dom 6.
App original code from Neil only works with @5.3.0
NPM says @5.3.2 does not exits.
=>  React app using old versions of some packages
    Might be difficult to get it to work with
    up to date packages.
Get some cryptic eslint errors about conflict
between package.json and something called BaseConfig
Solved by pressing CTRL-S on package.json, even though
it does not need to be saved.
PS seems enough just to x it away in the browser
